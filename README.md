# MNIST Digit Recognition + Drawing GUI
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the MNIST dataset to recognize handwritten digits.
Instead of providing an image file, the application opens a drawing window where the user can draw a digit. The model then processes the drawing in real time and predicts the digit.
