# MNIST Digit Recognition + Drawing GUI
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the MNIST dataset to recognize handwritten digits.\
Instead of providing an image file, the application opens a drawing window where the user can draw a digit. The model then processes the drawing in real time and predicts the digit.

## Features
- CNN trained on MNIST dataset
- ~99% validation accuracy
- Live drawing canvas using OpenCV
- Real-time digit prediction
- MNIST-style preprocessing pipeline
- Automatic centering and normalization
- Best model checkpoint saving
